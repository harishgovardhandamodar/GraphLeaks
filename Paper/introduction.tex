\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Different graph embedding algorithms to embed both the entire graphs as well as the nodes have been well studied~\cite{node2vec,deepwalk,line,sdme,graph2vec,harp}

adversarial attacks on graph embeddings have been explored~\cite{nodepoison} but the privacy risks of releasing embedding on the user's sensitive data are not well understood and studied

graph embedding are important~\cite{tutorial}


Privacy risks in machine learning have been explored using membership inference attacks~\cite{membershipinf}, property inference~\cite{propertyinf} and attribute inference attacks~\cite{attributeinf,attributeinf2,overlearninginf}.
Further, model extraction attacks aim to reconstruct the target model architecture via side channels~\cite{csinn,timing} and steal the functionality by training the reconstructed architecture on target model predictions as labels~\cite{stealml}.

connectivity Information in graphs are represented as adjacency matrix which is then used for various applications such as attribute prediction, clustering, link prediction, node classification.
Some algorithms transform these adjacency matrix (connectivity information) and convert it to a low dimension latent representation which can be used as features.
